Blinkt! Binary Counter
======================

This is an example I used to test the **disp_bin** Python function I wrote to take a number and display it in binary on a [Pimoroni Blinkt!](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/blinkt) board.  The function takes a number (of which it will display the lower 8 bits) and colors for the 0 and 1 LEDs.

Requires the blinkt Python module

```
sudo apt-get install python-blinkt
```
